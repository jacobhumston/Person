# Person

Created by jacobhumston as a fun project, also to learn how to use javascript classes.

# Installation

1. Copy and paste the `Person.js` file into wherever you plan on using it.
2. Install needed packages.

```
npm install uuid
```

# Usage

1. Require the `Person.js` file to use the Person class.

```javascript
const { Person } = require("./Person.js");
// Make sure to require the correct path.
```

2. Create as many people as you would like.

```javascript
const Carl = new Person("Carl", 22);
Carl.Log();
```

> You can view the `Test.js` file for an example.
